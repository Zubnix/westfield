            A singleton global object that provides support for shared
            memory.

            Clients can create wl_buffer objects using the create_buffer
            request.

            At connection setup time, the web_shm object emits one or more
            format events to inform clients about the valid pixel formats
            that can be used for buffers.

        <request name="create_web_array_buffer">
            <description summary="create an HTML5 array buffer">
                Create a web_array_buffer object.

                The buffer is created using an HTML5 array buffer as the fd argument
                and width and height as specified. The stride argument specifies
                the number of bytes from the beginning of one row to the beginning
                of the next. The format is the pixel format of the buffer and
                must be one of those advertised through the web_shm.format event.

                Creating a buffer with an HTML5 array buffer as the fd argument
                will attach the array buffer to the compositor and as such it can not be used
                by the client until the compositor detaches it. As such clients should
                wait for the compositor to emit the web_array_buffer detach event
                before using the array buffer again.

                A compositor will emit the detach event in conjunction with a wl_buffer release event.
                Clients should therefore only create a web_array_buffer after all data is written to
                the HTML5 array buffer, after which it should be immediately attach+commit to a surface.
